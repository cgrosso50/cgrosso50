- 👋 Hi, I’m @cgrosso50
- 🏁 Goal: To land a full-time role in SQL analysis, querying, editing, and/or administration. I am currently based in the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas. In addition to local roles, I will also be glad to pursue:
    - fully remote roles
    - in-person roles anywhere in the US, with the strongest preference for:
        - anywhere in Texas
        - within a 3 hour driving distance from South Bend, Indiana
        - the San Francisco Bay Area
- 🎓 Education: University of Notre Dame, Bachelor of Business Administration, IT Management major
- ⏪ Past work experience: My prior work background consists of four years as a software tester at the US's largest developer of healthcare IT, where I speclialized in testing internal parts of the software such as the database storing all medical records, user security, server load management, and more. In the midst of my job duties, I occassionally had to delve into extracting data into SQL form then manipulating it for reporting purposes, both in Microsoft SQL Server and in Oracle SQL.
- 💞️ In addition to working on my own personal projects (subject matter TBD) which I will showcase on this github, I’d be open to collaborate on others' projects where I can hone my skills in either SQL querying or SQL database-building/editing, so that I can have tangible examples of my abilities to help me land a full-time role.
