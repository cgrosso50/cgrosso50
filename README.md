- 👋 Hi, I’m @cgrosso50
- 👀 I’m interested in starting a career in SQL analysis. My prior work background consists of four years as a software tester at the US's largest developer of healthcare IT,
- where I speclialized in testing internal parts of the software such as the database storing all medical records, user security, server load management, and more. In the midst
- of my job duties, I occassionally had to delve into extracting data into SQL form then manipulating it for reporting purposes, both in Microsoft SQL Server and in Oracle SQL.
- I also hold a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Notre Dame, where I majored in IT Management.
- 💞️ In addition to working on my own personal projects (subject matter TBD), I’d be open to collaborate on any projects where I can hone my skills in either SQL querying or SQL
- database-building/editing, so that I can have tangible examples of my abilities to help me land a full-time role.
